# CodeAlpha Data Analytics Internship

## Project Overview
This repository contains my work for the CodeAlpha Data Analytics Internship.  
It currently covers:

- **Task 1: Web Scraping**
- **Task 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
- **Task 3: Data Visualization**

I scraped book data from an online bookstore, performed exploratory analysis, and created clear visualizations.

## Task 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

**Key Findings:**
- The dataset contains **100 books**.
- Columns available: Title, Price, Rating, and Availability.
- **Rating Distribution**:
  - Rating 1: 22 books
  - Rating 2: 19 books
  - Rating 3: 22 books
  - Rating 4: 18 books
  - Rating 5: 19 books

## Task 3: Data Visualization

I created the following visualizations using Matplotlib and Seaborn:

1. Number of Books by Rating
2. Average Book Price by Rating
3. Distribution of Book Prices
4. Box Plot of Price by Rating

**Files:**
- `visualization.py`
- `chart1_books_by_rating.png`
- `chart2_avg_price_by_rating.png`
- `chart3_price_distribution.png`
- `chart4_price_boxplot.png`
